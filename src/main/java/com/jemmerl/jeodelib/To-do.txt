GUI Elements needed, aka machine features

Zones:

By default, the GUI has one zone. Otherwise, smaller zones are nested one level deep inside the main outer zone.

The outer zone holds global properties, and all zones hold local.
    - E.G. the main zone holds the power, which is shared to all the smaller local zones.
      All zones have an independent temperature, including the main outer zone
      (consider this the machine "case"), and can propagate temperature between them.
      Basically, remember that's the global zone is local to itself as well


-------------------------------
Zone Properties:


Global Only:
- Power (VERTICAL)
- Belt Speed (HORIZ TEXT)

Local:
- Temperature (HORIZ TEXT)
- Pressure (HORIZ TEXT)
- RPM (HORIZ TEXT)
- Torque? (HORIZ TEXT)
- Processing Progress (GUI HOVER ELEMENT)

--------------------------------
Zone Elements available:

Global Only:
-

Local:
- Item I/O (SLOTS)
    - Includes "catalyst" slots if needed (catalysts could be materials or recipes, just something not consumed but needed)
- Fluids I/O
    - Storage Tank (VERTICAL)
    - I/O Slot (SLOTS)
*** Include colors to indicate I/O like TE does?


- Tool (SLOTS)

- Process Progress indicator (arrow is classic, but can be changed)
    - Hover over to see relevant data, like time left or time out of time left

- Sensors / Reactionaries (SLOTS)
    - Redstone behavior chips
        * E.G. how will this zone react to a redstone signal
    - Property Sensors (Before a temperature sensor is added, or even "better" ones, data will be non-existent to less accurate
        * E.G. "cold, warm, hot" -> "10, 20, 30" -> "11.3, 15.2, 103.5"
        * Some properties will have visual indicators, these may or may not need an item with the right sensing capability
        * Sensors can do things like output sounds
        * Senors may be able to be tuned
    - Fuses (Will turn the zone/system off when a condition is met as a fail safe)
        * Could be multi-use or single use
